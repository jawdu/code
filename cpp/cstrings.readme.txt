Originally written 2005 for disseration in MATLAB. This is 2013 conversion into c++ with lots of optimisation and methodological rationalisation. Simulation is recreation of Vachaspati & Vilenkin, 1984, Phys. Rev., D30, 2036 (https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.30.2036)

Compiles with g++ on a linux box (ubuntu or mint), but no responsibility accepted for anything that might happen.

Warning: simulation time will increase exponentially with mesh size. Keep mesh size under ~50 for quick runs, use ~10 for testing.
