### code

Code that isn't web stuff, by language. Folders might also have a codeGolf folder: playing around with ideas from codeGolf on stackexchange for practice.

  - merjd: another audio project, combine/merge music in unpredictable/noise style

  - ~~3BP: work in progress, probably going no further~~
  
  - fractan: implementing Conway's fractran programming language

  - elloget: quicky written as a favour for someone to automate workflow with emails, attachments (mostly synthesis of other people's work)

  - python codeGolf

    - simUniv: a universe simulation

- ruby

  - glijd: parallel to skrejd, a medium term create glitch audio project
