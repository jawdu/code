### code

Code that isn't web stuff, in the following folders:

- bash

  - lpnum: something to tidy up badly/untagged albums
  
  - subtime: manually create first run subtitle timings
  
- cpp

  - cstrings: rewrote my MPhys disseration code, from MATLAB into C++

- python

  - ~~3BP: work in progress~~
  
  - fractan: implementing Conway's fractran programming language

- ruby

Folders might also have a codeGolf folder: playing around with challenges from codeGolf on stackexchange for shits & kicks  practice.
