### code

Code that isn't web stuff, by language. codeGolf folders just playing around with ideas for practice, not much to see.

- bash

  - lpnum: something to tidy up badly/untagged albums
  
  - subtime: manually create first run subtitle timings

  - tidytext: cut&paste into newfile, tailored & obscurely useful for me and my txt scrapbooks

  - bkify: turn a text file into a pseudo mitteleuropa C20 text (a la Bernhard, Krasznahorkai, ...)

  - elogget.sh: control script for elogget.py, to automate an email workflow with attachments for elog
 
- cpp

  - cstrings: rewrote my MPhys disseration code, from MATLAB into C++

  - soundfw: barebones stuff needed to write a .wav in C++ (future project prep)

  - xnks: nascent experiment in producing sound; loose model/inspiration = Iannis Xenakis, etc.

- python

  - skrejd: parallel to glijd, medium term screw with audio project

  - merjd: another audio project, combine/merge music in unpredictable/noise style

  - ~~3BP: work in progress, probably going no further~~
  
  - fractan: implementing Conway's fractran programming language

  - elogget: written as a favour for someone to automate workflow with emails, attachments (mostly synthesis of other people's work), elog.
